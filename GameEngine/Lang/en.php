	All good things must come to an end, and so too must this age. Once solomon was given a ring, upon which was inscribed a message that could take away all the joys or sorrows of the world, that message was roughly translated "this too shall pass". It is both our joy and sorrow to announce to all Players that this too has now passed! We hope you enjoyed your time with us as much as we enjoyed serving you and thank you for staying until the very end!<br /><br />
The results:<br/>Day had long since passed into night, yet the workers in 
<a href="karte.php?d=%s&c=%s">%s</a>, laboured on throught the wintery eve, every wary of the countless armies marching to destroy their work, knowing that they raced against time and the greatest threat that had ever faced the free people. Their tireless struggles were rewared at <b>%s</b> on <b>%s</b> after a nameless worker laid the dinal stone in what will forever known as the greatest and most magnificent creation in all of history since the fall of the Natars.<br /><br /> 
Together with the alliance "<a href="allianz.php?aid=%s">%s</a>", "<a href="spieler.php?uid=%s">%s</a>" was the first to finish the Wonder of the World, using millions of resources whilst also protecting it with hundereds of thousands of brave defenders.

"<a href="spieler.php?uid=%s" title="Total Villages: %s <br/> Total Population: %s">%s</a>" was the ruler over the largest personal empire, followed closely by "<a href="spieler.php?uid=%s" title="Total Villages: %s <br/> Total Population: %s">%s</a>" and "<a href="spieler.php?uid=%s" title="Total Villages: %s <br/> Total Population: %s"> %s </a>".<br /><br />
"<a href="spieler.php?uid= %s" title="Total Villages: %s <br/> Attack Points: %s ">%s</a>" slew more than any other, and was the mightiest, most fearsome commander.<br /><br />
"<a href="spieler.php?uid=%s" title="Total Villages: %s <br/> Defence Points: %s ">%s</a>" was the most glorious defender, slaugtering enemies at the village gates, staining the lands around those villages with their blood.<br /><br />
